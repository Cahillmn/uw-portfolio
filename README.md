Adjustments for accessibility

I checked it in WAVE and it had no errors, no alerts and the contrast ratio is 8.59:1. Despite not having any errors I made the following changes to my page: 

I added the code to skip the nav bar and tab directly to the main content.

I added screen reader only text to describe where the links on the page go.

When I zoomed to 200%, my navbar list wrapped into my h1 making the visibility bad so I adjusted the font size to 1.4em to fix it.
